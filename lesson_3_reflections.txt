1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	
	1. away from my personal computer where my local repo is.
	(Having a remote repository, it means that I can work on projects anywhere
	and anytime. It could be at School Library or CS Labs, etc.)

	2. open source files

	3. collaborations with others


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	There is a time that you don't want the changes from remote repository.
	BY pulling changes manually, we have more freedom during the work process.


3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	forks: clone other people's repo on github directly to your github repo.
	       no permission to commit to the original repo. The owner has to add 
	       you as a collabrator.
	
	clones: clone local or/and remote/github repos to your local repo.
	
	branches: branches are on a single repo. You can push and pull branches.
	          You can only create a branches on a single repo.


4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	To see what has been changed compare to your local states. Can work offline
	to update and sync with the remote branch.
