1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    1. away from my personal computer where my local repo is.
        (Having a remote repository, it means that I can work on projects anywhere and anytime.
         It could be at School Library or CS Labs, etc.)
    2. open source files
    3. collaborations with others
