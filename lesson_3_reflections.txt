1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    1. away from my personal computer where my local repo is.
        (Having a remote repository, it means that I can work on projects anywhere and anytime.
         It could be at School Library or CS Labs, etc.)
    2. open source files
    3. collaborations with others
    
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

		There is a time that you don't want the changes from remote repository.
		BY pulling changes manually, we have more freedom during the work
		process.
